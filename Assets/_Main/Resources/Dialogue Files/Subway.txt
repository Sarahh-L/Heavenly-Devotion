Narrator "You decide to head into the subways and explore for a bit"
"There, {wa .8}you find an underground aquarium,{wa .8} bustling with life"
"Many aquatic species seem to reside here, a majority hidden behind a glass."
"It's...{wa .5} oddly peaceful, especially for a simple subway system."
"Though, you've been to an aquarium before. {wa .7}It was nothing new."
"You also find a random man on the stairs... {wa .9}hitting the jig... {wa .9}and yelling about global warming"

"The fish seem a lot more interesting after that."

Soon, you come across both Scylla and Mako, who...{wa .8} seem to be talking about violence?
Huh.{wa 1} Never took Mako as the type.
Though,{wa .5} he does look pretty uncomfortable...
Regardless, you decide to approach them.

Highlight(Scylla)
Scylla "Hm?"
Mako "Why... why do you have a knife?"
Scylla.Animate(-a Hop)
Scylla "Hm? {wa .5} oh, {wa .3} this?"
"It's a warning."
Mako "..."
"To who?"
Scylla "Remember that guy who just bumped into you?"
"Like"
"Thirty minutes ago?"
Mako "... {wa .3} yes?"
Scylla "Him."
Mako "Wh- {wa .2} why?!"
"I'm fine! See? {wa .5}No harm done!"
"Please put the knife away..."
Scylla "Hah! No way! No one is gonna bump into my bestie and get away with it."
"Guy didn't even say sorry!"
"Can you believe that?"
"Ridiculous"
Mako "Scylla, he was blind!"
"He had a walking cane!"
Scylla "Excuses."
Mako.Animate(-a Hop)
Mako "No!"

Narrator "..."
"Well, this is quite the predicament"
"Seems like Scylla is dead set on committing a felony"
"... With a steak knife"
"You're almost tempted to see how this will go, though looking back at Mako you notice how panicked he seems"
"Maybe you should step in?"

Choice "..."
{
    - "Yea! He deserves it! He should've been looking where he was going."
    Mako "He was blind!"
    Scylla "See?! Even they agree!"
    "Besides, it's not like he apologized for any of it!"
    "It's only fair if we bump him a bit"
    "... off of the platform"
    Mako "Scylla, no!"

    Narrator "Before you even realize it, Scylla is running off, making a beeline towards a little old man in a walker with mako following quickly"
    "You feel a little guilty, but then again..."
    "It was pretty rude."
    

    - "Maybe you should just talk to him instead of trying to jump a blind man?"
    Mako "Y-yea! {wa .5} There's no need to attack some... poor old guy."
    Scylla "..."
    "That's... {wa .5}so..."
    "Boring!"
    "C'mon, seriously?! He was rude! The least he deserves is to get his cane kicked in!"
    Mako "Scylla!"
    Scylla "What?!"
