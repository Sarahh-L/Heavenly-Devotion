Narrator "You decide to head into the kitchen for a quick snack.." playSong("Intro Song" -v 1)

Narrator "You find a half eaten bag of chips and a bag of bread rolls"

Narrator "You really should go to the store"

Narrator "Using your incredible cooking skills, you put the chips in the bread and topped it off with buffalo sauce"

Narrator "It turns out to be not the worst thing you’ve eaten! You earn +1 Smarts"



Narrator "You spot Luke out of the corner of your eye, seemingly yelling at something… Is that smoke?"

Luke: "Dammit, Sunny! I told you to add water to it!"

Sunny: "And how was I supposed to know you needed water to make noodles?!"

Luke: "YOU ARE MEANT TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS."
Luke: "You know... /THE ONES ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX/."

Sunny: "Psh! Those are for amateurs! I’m a professional, and besides, I like my food a little burnt!"

Luke: "It is far from burnt- it’s charred, you /idiot/."

Sunny: "Charred, schmarred, all I know is that it tastes like perfection!"
Sunny: "You. dear boy, simply have horrible taste!"

Luke: "...Excuse you?"

Sunny: "You heard me! Why, I bet you couldn’t tell the difference between cow manure and a fresh apple pie!"
Sunny: "I mean, after all, if your taste in food is anything like your fashion sense, you have no say in what is acceptable."

Luke: "Why you little. . ."

Narrator "Yikes... Talk about bad timing..."
Narrator "Luke looks like he's about to pummel Sunny, AND your kitchen may just burn down in the process.."
Narrator "Maybe you should say someting to break up this little debate?"
